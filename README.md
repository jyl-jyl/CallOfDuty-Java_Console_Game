### How to Play Call of Duty
Before the game begins, the program places all targets randomly in such a way that no buildings are immediately adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Take a look at the following diagrams for examples of legal and illegal placements. (Notes: Tanks and oil drums are not buildings, so they could be placed directly adjacent to each other, or to buildings.)
